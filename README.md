Bamboo is a continuous integration and continuous deployment server. Learn more about [Bamboo](<https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo>).


# Overview

This Docker container makes it easy to get an instance of Bamboo up and running.

** We strongly recommend you run this image using a specific version tag instead of latest. This is because the image referenced by the latest tag changes often and we cannot guarantee that it will be backwards compatible. **

# Quick Start

For the `BAMBOO_HOME` directory that is used to store, among other things, the configuration data
 we recommend mounting a host directory as a [data volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/#/data-volumes), or using a named volume. 

Volume permission is managed by entry scripts. To get started you can use a data volume, or named volumes. In this example we'll use named volumes.

    $> docker volume create --name bambooVolume
    $> docker run -v bambooVolume:/var/atlassian/application-data/bamboo --name="bamboo" --init -d -p 54663:54663 -p 8085:8085 prepend2/bamboo

Note that this command can be replaced by named volumes.

Start Atlassian Bamboo:

    $> docker run -v /data/bamboo:/var/atlassian/application-data/bamboo --name="bamboo-server" --host=bamboo-server --init -d -p 54663:54663 -p 8085:8085 prepend2/bamboo

**Success**. Bamboo is now available on [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085)*. 

Note that the `--init` flag is required to properly reap zombie processes.

Make sure your container has the necessary resources allocated to it.
We recommend 2GiB of memory allocated to accommodate the application server.
See [Supported Platforms](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Bamboo/Supported+platforms) for further information.

## JVM Configuration

If you need to override Bamboo's default memory configuration or pass additional JVM arguments, use the environment variables below

* `JVM_MINIMUM_MEMORY` (default: 512m)

   The minimum heap size of the JVM

* `JVM_MAXIMUM_MEMORY` (default: 1024m)

   The maximum heap size of the JVM

* `JVM_SUPPORT_RECOMMENDED_ARGS` (default: NONE)

   Additional JVM arguments for Bamboo, such as a custom Java Trust Store

# Upgrade

To upgrade to a more recent version of Bamboo you can simply stop the `bamboo`
container and start a new one based on a more recent image:

    $> docker stop bamboo
    $> docker rm bamboo
    $> docker pull prepend2/bamboo:<desired_version>
    $> docker run ... (See above)

As your data is stored in the data volume directory on the host it will still
be available after the upgrade.

_Note: Please make sure that you **don't** accidentally remove the `bamboo`
container and its volumes using the `-v` option._

# Backup

For evaluations you can use the built-in database that will store its files in the Bamboo home directory. In that case it is sufficient to create a backup archive of the directory on the host that is used as a volume (`/data/bamboo` in the example above).

# Versioning

The `latest` tag matches the most recent version of this repository. Thus using `atlassian/bamboo-server:latest` or `atlassian/bamboo-server` will ensure you are running the most up to date version of this image.

However,  we ** strongly recommend ** that for non-eval workloads you select a specific version in order to prevent breaking changes from impacting your setup.
You can use a specific minor version of Bamboo by using a version number tag: `atlassian/bamboo-server:6.7`. This will install the latest `6.7.x` stable version that is available.

# Running Bamboo Server with a Remote Agent
If you want to run Bamboo Server and Agent containers on one host (in one Docker engine), you will need to create a Docker network for them:

    $> docker network create bamboo
    
You can start Bamboo Server using following commands:

    $> docker run -v bambooVolume:/var/atlassian/application-data/bamboo --name bamboo-server --network bamboo --hostname bamboo-server --init -d -p 8085:8085 prepend2/bamboo

# Known issues

* No support for configuring a reverse proxy for Bamboo.

# Change log

## 6.7.1

Repository-stored Specs (RSS) are no longer processed in Docker by default. Running RSS in Docker was not possible because:

* there is no Docker capability added on the Bamboo server by default,
* the setup would require running Docker in Docker.

The change will affect fresh Bamboo installations. Upgrades and XML imports will still require the RSS settings to be
changed manually in *Administration* &rarr; *Security settings*.

Tomcat was upgraded to version 8.5.32. Default security settings were made more strict for umask, instead of 0022 it's 0027. If you want to keep same behavior use "-e UMASK=0022" variable when run Docker image, e.g.
    
    $> docker run -d --name=bamboo671  -p 8085:8085 -p 54663:54663 -e UMASK=0022 -v bambooVolume:/var/atlassian/application-data/bamboo prepend2/bamboo:6.7.1
